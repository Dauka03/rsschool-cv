## Code examples
### Bubble sorting
* We go through the entire array and compare the current element with the next one.
* If the current element is larger than the next one, we swap them.
* We note that the exchange took place.
* If the exchange has occurred, we go through the array from the beginning.
* We know that the array is sorted when there will be no more exchanges.
```
function bubbleSortConcept1(arr) {
  for (let j = arr.length - 1; j > 0; j--) {
    for (let i = 0; i < j; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        let temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
